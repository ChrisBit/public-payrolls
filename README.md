# public-payrolls
A site for exploring the components of pay for public servants in Nebraska's myriad government entities.

## Overview

The Nebraska Public Payrolls project offers citizens a one-stop shop to understanding the largest expense in most governmental bodies: personnel. The website and database are designed to let users see the details of payroll and make comparisons between similar employees, departments, and governmental agencies. 
The public payroll project differs from similar offerings in that it aims to share detailed, nuanced information about public spending, rather than optimize to prurient interests of who gets how much in their paycheck. To that end, in addition to base pay, overtime, vacation payouts and other components of pay are a focus of the effort.

## Specs

 -  **User-friendly.** Design allows users to search for an individual employee or browse by agency type (city, county, etc.) or department (Police, library, etc.).
 - **Evergreen.** Can accommodate multiple years of data for any agency or department.
 - **Indexable**. Each agency, department and employee should have a single, SEO-friendly page.
